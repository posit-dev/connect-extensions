# Publisher Command Center

**Publisher Command Center** is a web-based application designed to help publishers manage and track their content.

## Setup

After deploying **Publisher Command Center**, you'll need to add a Visitor API Key integration.

In Posit Connect go to the app's control panel on the right of the screen, in
the Access tab, click **"Add integration"**, then select a **Visitor API Key**
integration.

If you don't see one in the list, an administrator must enable this feature on your Connect server.
See the [Admin Guide](https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/integrations/oauth-integrations/connect/) for setup instructions.
