## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for frontend development)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (for backend development)
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (for running backend server)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
uv sync
```

### Running the Development Server

Start the frontend development server:

```sh
npm run preview
```

Start the backend development server:

```sh
npm run server
```

Start the watcher to enable continuous rebuilds of the frontend:

```sh
npm run watch
```


### Building for Production

To build the frontend for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

### Publishing on Connect

This extension utilizes the [Connect API OAuth Integration](https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/integrations/oauth-integrations/connect/index.html#create-connect-api-integration-in-posit-connect).

After deploying the extension create a Connect API Viewer role integration, if
one doesn't already exist on the server, and select it as a integration.
