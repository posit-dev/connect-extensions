# Content Health Monitor

This report uses the publisherâ€™s API key to monitor a single piece of content. It checks whether the content is 
reachable, but does not validate its functionality. If scheduled to run regularly, it will send an email alert if the 
content becomes unreachable.

# Setup

The following environment variables are required when previewing the report locally.

```bash:
# Required variables
CONNECT_SERVER  # Set automatically when deployed to Connect
CONNECT_API_KEY # Set automatically when deployed to Connect
MONITORED_CONTENT_GUID # GUID for the content to monitor
```	

# Usage

Deploy the Content Health Monitor to Connect, then follow the setup instructions, and then refresh (re-render) the report.

## Extending Validation

By default, the monitor only checks HTTP status codes.

For more advanced validation, modify the `validate()` function in `content_health_utils.py`. You can add checks for expected text, specific HTML elements, or any other content validation logic.


# Testing

The Content Health Monitor includes a comprehensive test suite. Follow these simple steps to run the tests:

## Running Tests

1. Install project requirements and test dependencies with `uv`:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv pip install pytest
```

2. Run the tests with `uv`:
