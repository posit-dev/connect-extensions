# Contributing to the Simple MCP Server Extension

## Local Development

For local testing and development:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the server locally
python main.py
```

The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:8001` with the MCP endpoint at `/mcp`.
