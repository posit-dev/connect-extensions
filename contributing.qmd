Add your extension in the `extensions/` subdirectory.

To help you get started, call `make create-extension DIR=my_extension_name` to create a new extension directory with the necessary files. Note, you will need to manually create your `manifest.json` file.

<br />

## Required files

### `manifest.json`

Use `rsconnect` or `rsconnect-python` to generate a manifest, which is required as part of the extension bundle

### `connect-extension.qmd`

A file that has the name of your extension, the categories it falls into, and a brief description

```{filename="connect-extension.qmd"}
{{< include _template/connect-extension.qmd >}}
```

### `connect-extension.toml`

A file with the name, title, a brief description of the extension, and the access type it should have on being created

```{filename="connect-extension.toml"}
{{< include _template/connect-extension.toml >}}
```
